                    Have you seen amazing nature photography with turtles and tortoises as the subject?
                    How do you know which one you are looking at?

                    Turtle vs. Tortoise - There are a few differences between turtles and tortoises.
                    Tortoises are exclusively land-dwelling animals, and if they are put in deep water they will drown.
                    While tortoises are technically turtles, not all turtles are tortoises.
                    The best way to tell the difference between the two is to look at their feet!
                    Tortoises have elephant-like, unwebbed feet, and turtles have webbed feet for swimming.
