#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
## Description:
This is a website that educates people on the value, fun and significance of turtles in our lives. It includes beautiful images and a video to immerse the visitor in the experience.Each page has navigation links to other pages on my website or in some cases to other websites, based on the selected topic of interest.
#### Title Page:
The website starts off with a title and navigation page, entitled "Beneath the Shell". On this page is a short paragraph to describe the behavior turtles are known for and an invitaton to disocver more. At the top of the page is the title. Just underneath are text links that act as buttons. These buttons navigate the visitor to another page on the website based on their selected interest. The 5 main pages that the buttons provide links to are "Conservation", "Snorkel Encounters", "Turtles As Pets", "Turtle Photography", and "Turtle Toys". There is a background image of a tortoise shell up close that covers the body area of the page. Overlaid on the background is a stunning picture of sea turtle gliding through clear blue waters.
## Badges:
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.
## Visuals:
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
## Installation:
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
## Usage:
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
## Support:
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
## Roadmap:
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
## Authors and acknowledgment:
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.
## Project status:
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
